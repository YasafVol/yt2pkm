Lindsay Williams,UCtTPKajNXJOTibUTwrjIJMg,"¡Hola! I’m Lindsay.

I do languages. And I’m on a mission to teach you how to learn a language. Yes, you! My courses and programs are a big part of that mission because it’s all about making language learning fun and still making progress. Win win, huh?

I’ve recently completed my MA in Applied Linguistics and spent the past 2 decades plus of my life learning languages, which means I know a thing or two about how to do this thing. 

When I’m not sharing how to learn languages on the internet, I’m trying new-to-me sports (because being a beginner is the best!), hunting down vintage jewellery, and playing with my tortoise Gonzo (who speaks a grand total of zero languages).

Luca Lampariello,UCOJ88yDbqOkAZXNuuYpAAAA,"Hello, everybody. This channel is dedicated to my greatest passion -- languages.  

My name is Luca and I'm from Italy.  

 I've been studying languages for about 20 years and a few years ago I reached a very important conclusion: languages cannot be taught; they can only be learned.  Once you realize that it totally changes your approach and you understand why the famous ""language classes"" have such a low success rate.  

So I decided to share not only my passion for languages but also techniques for studying them, with optimism, passion, effective methods and experience.  Learning a new language takes time but it's not difficult.  

My mission is to help people understand that. If anyone tells you you that just knowing English is enough tell him ""he who learns another language acquires another soul"".

Linking Your Thinking with Nick Milo,UC85D7ERwhke7wVqskV_DZUA,"This is an exciting time in ""Personal Knowledge Management"". 

We now have the power to create something wonderfully meaningful—to us—and the people in our orbit.

With [[Linking Your Thinking]], my prime directive is helping you get more joy out of your digital notes. 

You're going to be at home here. Especially if:

 - You don't want to lose thoughts
 - You might want to build and create things
 - You are an independent thinker and interested in many things

And perhaps most importantly: You find thinking to be inherently valuable.

So...

If you're tired of switching apps and chasing the shiny stuff—and you're ready to regain a sense of trust and mastery with your digital notes...

And you're okay with putting in the work...

Then I promise you, that you can develop your own personalized, antifragile, flexible, and future-proofed PKM system.

It will be a system you can create and grow with—over decades.

And it will be a system that can give you peace of mind and tremendous joy.

- I'm a software engineer who's IN LOVE with computers and content creation.

• Why did you create this channel?
- I enjoy learning and I always feel excited to share what I've learned with other people. And I think there's no better place to share my knowledge with the world than YouTube.

• What kind of tutorials can we expect to see in the future?
- Currently, basic level tutorials for fellow beginners. The level will eventually increase as I keep learning new things.

• Why ""WebGL tutorials"" on your banner instead of ""Three.js tutorials""?
- Because I have a plan to make tutorials on other WebGL technologies in the future such as Babylon.js and more Pixi.js tutorials.

• I see you have some Firebase database and authentication tutorials. Any plans to do more of them?
- I don't think so.

• Can I make requests for tutorials?

Alec Steele,UCWizIdwZdmr43zfxlCktmNw,"My name's Alec Steele and here you'll find near-daily videos documenting the process of building some awesome projects here in the shop. As a blacksmith, most of the projects start as lumps of steel, or stacks of different alloys for making damascus, that I forge out into blades, sculpture, art or tools before taking the project to the machining equipment or into the grinding room for finishing. Each project teaches me a lot and stretches the bounds of my knowledge. I make a lot of mistakes but they serve as an excellent teacher. There's always something important for me to learn in the shop! 

I want my work to be the spark that ignites the desire for you to get into your shop (or kitchen/basement/garage) and make something too! Whether it's stitching a leather wallet or forging a giant sword, you'll love the creative process.

Bad Normals,UCvigl2g67gl18hJgFex-3zg,"I make 3D related content. In addition to 3D, I also like music production and black humor. And different languages, too. So that's me.

FAQ:
How did you learn Blender? 

I often get emails and comments asking about how I have managed to get ""so good"" in Blender. First, thanks for saying that!
Secondly, the main reason is that I have now been doing 3D full time each day for over a year. And this one year has improved me much more than previous five where I just dabbled around pretty much aimlessly. My recommendation: consistently start and finish many personal projects in a row and reflect on what you learned in each one. The results will come.

You retain more information, you pay more attention, you’re much more likely to continue learning and more likely to go back and re-watch tutorials. And it will leave you more inspired and motivated to go practice.

Students spend hundreds of hours using these tools over the course of their education (and thousands over their career), so it makes sense to make the experience as fluid and frictionless as possible.

In addition to the videos I also regularly publish free PDF painting guides over at www.sorastro.com.

MainSqueezeMusic,UC0Wu8k-3Yc6tro6KYmLZRvQ,"There seems to be an aura in the air when the five members of The Main Squeeze enter a room. A multicultural five-piece from Los Angeles, CA, The Main Squeeze have built a cult following in the States on the road – putting rubber to pavement and playing over 1,000 shows together over the past nine years. For a group of men with completely different backgrounds, tastes, religions, and opinions, there’s already a spirit shared amongst them when they sit down to play together. 
 
The Main Squeeze are coming off their sixth studio album “To Be Determined” - a body of work showcasing the unique chemistry the Los Angeles, CA based band have developed together over the years. The album is a stunning showcase into why they have become a touring phenomenon in the US and around the world.

Shoo Rayner Drawing,UCaQOnL-tNULRYma5nRDy1QA,"I’m Shoo Rayner. I've been a children's book author and illustrator for most of my life. I’ve illustrated over 300 children’s books for major international publishers.

Here, on the ShooRaynerDrawing YouTube Channel, I teach and encourage traditional pen, ink and watercolour skills for sketching, journaling and illustration for both beginners and more experienced artists.

Pen ink and Watercolour are tried and trusted traditional media that scan well for printing and sharing digitally. Watercolour is not for kids! It requires a different mindset to master it. Don’t think of it as painting – it’s drawing with light!

Join me weekly for tutorials, and inspirational chats to keep you on the path to mastering this style and technique.

Your questions and problems are most welcome – my videos are for you and that’s how I get ideas for new videos! use the comments box or the contact info email.

Relax24,UCBK-IXazHYcYit0K3ESnaxg,"Relax24 offers long  videos featuring rain, beaches, waterfalls and any other sound that helps people relax or sleep.
